# Polymorphism
# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes
# to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
# This is achieved by defining methods in the superclass
# that can be overridden by the subclasses.


# There are two concepts in polymorphism
# Method Overloading
# Method Overridding
